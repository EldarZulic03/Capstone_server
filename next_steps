read chatbot code, create a wrapper to train and set current model. Need a way to get a list of text responses we need snipptes for. Need to also store the dictionary results from the front end in the loved one dir as pickled object.

On add of loved on, save the dict under the loved one, save the chatbot model since this will need to be reused (other ml models pickling less important for now since usually only run once). Then do voice synthesis on all these responses and put it under the snippets dir. Then for every wav in the snippets create an mp4 with deepfake. Name should be the text response. the start of the storage url should be stored in front end then inde <storage_url_base>/p_idx/lo_idx/<snippet_name> and for the conversation we just run user input through chatbot and send back response then they can just add to url and play the snippet.

for testing I can create a dummy_people_data directory with images, audio and responses already in there

multiple parallel processes for sentence synthesis and for request handling

need to either use firebase for audio and image or neither. its looking like both rn so lets see.

on delete need to cleanfirebase storage

mhm and okay snippets for everyone

parallel
chatbot 2 functions for wrapper
endpoint for response gen (need to load models from pickle into memory etc)
process dictionary w loved one and patient responses
video download and rename/convert to wav in local storage
add faisal to github

firebase in frontend

placeholder image in frontend so we dont have to keep messing with backend filesystem

get rid of button to load loved ones in frontend
