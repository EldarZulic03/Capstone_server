transfer audio file
error handling
on reception of audio train a synthesizer and pickle it under the loved one dir
in people manager, when we create a loved one we should create a folder where all the result snippets go for audio and then video from the syncing

for text training data have a dictionary { Q : A } so we can just send to python and in python just pickle and save it under that loved one
front-end needs input for the chatbot which we need endpoints for

curr_vid = nod_and_smile
while true:
	play video
	get user response
	get bot response video to play
	curr_vid = new_vid

Alamofire setup and integration
Get deepsake and voice synth working on mac
create a list of sentences that we need videos from. When we add loved ones create all those videos, save the voice synthesizer in the right file as well
setup firebase
Setup front->backend call to upload loved one answers
facetime call
arch -x86_64 python -m pip install PyQt5

make sure recorded audio is correct (play in ui to double check)
give them a sentence to read out perhaps

ml models should operate in terms of filepaths and path.exitst etc. The patient/loved one information should not be mixed in with the ml modules. Abstract it away, as far as ml models are concerned they deal with file paths. We tell you where audio, image are and ask you to fetch pickled model if it exists etc


for voice synth

create_model_from_path(path, name)
save_current_model_to_path(path)
set_current_model(name)
load_model_from_path_if_exists(path,name)

can do similar stuff for wav2lip wrapper.
Need to create a folder under loved ones where the snippets will go

Next Steps:
Integrate and update wrappers
Test with hardset list of words to gen all voice snippets
Test uploading to firebase

platform for pod

init ml models once (save some runtime overhead, atleast for the VC idk about the deepfake)
need to create voice snippter folder under the loved ones directory

on loved one creation we need to make a folder where the generated snippets go, on delete of loved one or patient we need to do some cleaning in firebase
